2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run jupyter notebook first Part_A_groupT.ipynb and then Part_B_groupT.ipynb to see the code and results with explanations. We used uv as package manager and as environment manager, but you can also use pip and virtualenv or conda.
